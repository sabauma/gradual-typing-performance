========

Simple example programs to be traced.

- `hello-world` constant flows in one direction
- `factorial` function flows in one direction
- `even` functions flow in both directions
- `struct` check contract generation for all struct fields
- `opaque` check contract generation for opaque types
- `tt` typed to typed, ensure that contracts are made
- `adapt` test adaptor module, make sure all from/to are sensible filenames
- `list` check if `list/c` contracts are counted, or only the contracts on list elements

To test, run the file `main.rkt` in each folder.
These `main.rkt` files contain example output, in comments.
