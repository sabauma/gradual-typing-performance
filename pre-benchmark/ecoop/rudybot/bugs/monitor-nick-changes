Version 3229d33:

I did 

        top-eval (out "NICK absurdlylongnick")

, and thenceforth, it ignored all commands addressed to it with that
new nick.  I then did
                                                                                                
        rudybot: top-eval (out "NICK rudybot")

and that straightened it out.

I assume it didn't realize that its own nick had changed.  I should
monitor messages from the server, and if I see one that basically says
"foo changed his nick to bar", and if my current nick is indeed foo, I
should update it to bar.
