Benchmarks
----------

To run these benchmarks, run the run-all script:

  ./run-all.sh

This will first compile all of the benchmark variations (this will take
a few minutes) and then execute them for 30 iterations each.
This will take many hours (12+).

The resulting "acquire.png" and "gofish.png" files will show the
lattice diagrams from the paper for the benchmark run.
