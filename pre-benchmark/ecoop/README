How to test out the artifact programs
-------------------------------------

All of the artifact programs that are libraries are installed into
the Racket installation on this image. Therefore running most of
the sample programs is easy.

Note: the programs may run better if they are compiled first with
      `raco make -v <the-file>.rkt`. Some of the programs are
      pre-compiled already.

Here are sample invocations that will test each program in this
directory:

  Letters/Tooltip: built into DrRacket

  Big-bang:
    racket big-bang-test.rkt

  Esquire:
    racket racket-esquire.rkt

  Minesweeper: (will only work from that directory)
    cd mines
    racket typed-mines.rkt

  Cards: (run Aces or Go-Fish benchmark to try out)

  Markdown:
    scribble --markdown test.scrbl

  DB: testing this is more complicated, so we have provided an IRC
      client that uses SQLite as a large test case.

    cd rudybot
    racket -tm freenode-main.rkt

    (Note that this will run an IRC bot that connects to the
     Freenode server. The bot will respond to messages with quotes
     from its corpus database.)

  Aces:
    racket aces/aces.rkt

  Slidey: run from `plt-games` executable 

  Acquire/Go-Fish: see README in the benchmarks/ folder
