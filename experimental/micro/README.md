micro
=====

This folder contains existing benchmarks that have been ported to 'micro' gradual typing style.
Each module now defines a single function.

Goals:
- compare overhead, identify bottlenecks
- try scaling our approach
- learn something to share with the micro world
- test sampling techniques
