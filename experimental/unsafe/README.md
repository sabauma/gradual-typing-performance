unsafe
======

Unsafe-data versions of some benchmarks.
Data access is completely unprotected. How much time do we save?

(It's a lot, but doesn't change the overall "death" picture)

Also, `module-graphs/` has TiKZ graphs for these "data-free" projects
(since they have fewer modules than the original experiments)
